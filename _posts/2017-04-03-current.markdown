### Commercial Projects

KÄ“laHealth is a start-up that I co-founded during my research fellowship at Duke. We take patient factors and use machine-learning to accurately predict surgical complication risk at the point-of-care, then connect high risk patients to impactful interventions. Our goal is to improve surgical outcomes and reduce the financial and societal cost for patients undergoing surgery.
